	This work presents HiLMa-Res, a hierarchical framework leveraging 
	reinforcement learning to tackle manipulation tasks while performing 
	continuous locomotion using quadrupedal robots. Unlike most previous 
	efforts that focus on solving a specific task, HiLMa-Res is designed 
	to be general for various loco-manipulation tasks that require 
	quadrupedal robots to maintain sustained mobility. The novel design 
	of this framework tackles the challenges of integrating continuous 
	locomotion control and manipulation using legs. It develops an 
	operational space locomotion controller that can track arbitrary 
	robot end-effector (toe) trajectories while walking at different 
	velocities. This controller is designed to be generic to different 
	downstream tasks, and therefore, can be utilized in high-level 
	manipulation planning policy to address specific tasks. To 
	demonstrate the versatility of this framework, we utilize HiLMa-Res 
	to tackle several challenging loco-manipulation tasks using a 
	quadrupedal robot in the real world. These tasks span from 
	leveraging state-based policy to vision-based policy, from training 
	purely from the simulation data to learning from real-world data. 
	In these tasks, HiLMa-Res shows better performance than other 
	methods.
