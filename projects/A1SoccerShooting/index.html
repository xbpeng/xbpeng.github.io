	We address the problem of enabling quadrupedal robots to perform precise shooting
	skills in the real world using reinforcement learning. Developing algorithms to
	enable a legged robot to shoot a soccer ball to a given target is a challenging
	problem that combines robot motion control and planning into one task. To solve
	this problem, we need to consider the dynamics limitation and motion stability
	during the control of a dynamic legged robot. Moreover, we need to consider motion
	planning to shoot the hard-to-model deformable ball rolling on the ground with
	uncertain friction to a desired location. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
	framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train (a) a robust motion
	control policy that can track arbitrary motions and (b) a planning policy to decide
	the desired kicking motion to shoot a soccer ball to a target. We deploy the
	proposed framework on an A1 quadrupedal robot and enable it to accurately shoot
	the ball to random targets in the real world.
