	Recent years have seen a surge in commercially-available and affordable
	quadrupedal robots, with many of these platforms being actively used in
	research and industry. As the availability of legged robots grows, so
	does the need for controllers that enable these robots to perform useful
	skills. However, most learning-based frameworks for controller
	development focus on training robot-specific controllers, a process that
	needs to be repeated for every new robot. In this work, we introduce a
	framework for training generalized locomotion (GenLoco) controllers for
	quadrupedal robots. Our framework synthesizes general-purpose locomotion
	controllers that can be deployed on a large variety of quadrupedal robots
	with similar morphologies. We present a simple but effective morphology
	randomization method that procedurally generates a diverse set of
	simulated robots for training. We show that by training a controller on
	this large set of simulated robots, our models acquire more general
	control strategies that can be directly transferred to novel simulated
	and real-world robots with diverse morphologies, which were not observed
	during training.
