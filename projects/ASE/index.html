	The incredible feats of athleticism demonstrated by humans are
	made possible in part by a vast repertoire of general-purpose
	motor skills, acquired through years of practice and experience.
	These skills not only enable humans to perform complex tasks,
	but also provide powerful priors for guiding their behaviors
	when learning new tasks. This is in stark contrast to what is
	common practice in physics-based character animation, where
	control policies are most typically trained from scratch for
	each task. In this work, we present a large-scale data-driven
	framework for learning versatile and reusable skill embeddings
	for physically simulated characters. Our approach combines
	techniques from adversarial imitation learning and unsupervised
	reinforcement learning to develop skill embeddings that produce
	life-like behaviors, while also providing an easy to control
	representation for use on new downstream tasks. Our models can
	be trained using large datasets of unstructured motion clips,
	without requiring any task-specific annotation or segmentation
	of the motion data. By leveraging a massively parallel GPU-based
	simulator, we are able to train skill embeddings using over a
	decade of simulated experiences, enabling our model to learn a
	rich and versatile repertoire of skills. We show that a single
	pre-trained model can be effectively applied to perform a diverse
	set of new tasks. Our system also allows users to specify tasks
	through simple reward functions, and the skill embedding then
	enables the character to automatically synthesize complex and
	naturalistic strategies in order to achieve the task objectives.
