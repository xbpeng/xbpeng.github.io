	Specifying reward signals that allow agents to learn complex behaviors is
	a longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning. A promising approach is
	to extract preferences for behaviors from unlabeled videos, which are
	widely available on the internet. We present Video Prediction Rewards (VIPER),
	an algorithm that leverages pretrained video prediction models as action-free
	reward signals for reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first train an
	autoregressive transformer on expert videos and then use the video prediction
	likelihoods as reward signals for a reinforcement learning agent. VIPER
	enables expert-level control without programmatic task rewards across a wide
	range of DMC, Atari, and RLBench tasks. Moreover, generalization of the video
	prediction model allows us to derive rewards for an out-of-distribution
	environment where no expert data is available, enabling cross-embodiment
	generalization for tabletop manipulation. We see our work as starting point
	for scalable reward specification from unlabeled videos that will benefit
	from the rapid advances in generative modeling.
