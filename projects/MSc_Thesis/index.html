	While physics-based models for passive phenomena such as cloth and fluids have 
	been widely adopted in computer animation, physics-based character simulation 
	remains a challenging problem. One of the major hurdles for character simulation 
	is that of control, the modeling of a character's behaviour in response to its 
	goals and environment. This challenge is further compounded by the 
	high-dimensional and complex dynamics that often arise from these systems. A 
	popular approach to mitigating these challenges is to build reduced models 
	that capture important properties for a particular task. These models often 
	leverage significant human insight, and may nonetheless overlook important 
	information. In this thesis, we explore the application of deep reinforcement 
	learning (DeepRL) to develop control policies that operate directly using 
	high-dimensional low-level representations, thereby reducing the need for 
	manual feature engineering and enabling characters to perform more challenging 
	tasks in complex environments.

	We start by presenting a DeepRL framework for developing policies that allow 
	character to agilely traverse across irregular terrain. The policies are 
	represented using a mixture of experts model, which selects from a small 
	collection of parameterized controllers. Our method is demonstrated on planar 
	characters of varying morphologies and different classes of terrain. Through 
	the learning process, the networks develop the appropriate strategies for 
	traveling across various irregular environments without requiring extensive 
	feature engineering. Next, we explore the effects of different action 
	parameterizations on the performance of RL policies. We compare policies 
	trained using low-level actions, such as torques, target velocities, target 
	angles, and muscle activations. Performance is evaluated using a motion 
	imitation benchmark. For our particular task, the choice of higher-level 
	actions that incorporate local feedback, such as target angles, leads to 
	significant improvements in performance and learning speed. Finally, we 
	describe a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for controlling 
	the motion of a simulated 3D biped. By training each level of the hierarchy 
	to operate at different spatial and temporal scales, the character is able 
	to perform a variety of locomotion tasks that require a balance between 
	short-term and long-term planning. Some of the tasks include soccer dribbling, 
	path following, and navigation across dynamic obstacles.
