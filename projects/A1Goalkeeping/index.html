	We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal
	robots to perform soccer goalkeeping tasks in the real world. Soccer
	goalkeeping using quadrupeds is a challenging problem, that combines highly
	dynamic locomotion with precise and fast non-prehensile object (ball)
	manipulation. The robot needs to react to and intercept a potentially flying
	ball using dynamic locomotion maneuvers in a very short amount of time,
	usually less than one second. In this paper, we propose to address this
	problem using a hierarchical model-free RL framework. The first component
	of the framework contains multiple control policies for distinct locomotion
	skills, which can be used to cover different regions of the goal. Each
	control policy enables the robot to track random parametric endeffector
	trajectories while performing one specific locomotion skill, such as jump,
	dive, and sidestep. These skills are then utilized by the second part of
	the framework which is a high-level planner to determine a desired skill
	and end-effector trajectory in order to intercept a ball flying to different
	regions of the goal. We deploy the proposed framework on a Mini Cheetah
	quadrupedal robot and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for
	various agile interceptions of a fast-moving ball in the real world.
