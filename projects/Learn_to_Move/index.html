	Modeling human motor control and predicting how humans will move in novel environments
	is a grand scientific challenge. Researchers in the fields of biomechanics and motor
	control have proposed and evaluated motor control models via neuromechanical
	simulations, which produce physically correct motions of a musculoskeletal model.
	Typically, researchers have developed control models that encode physiologically
	plausible motor control hypotheses and compared the resulting simulation behaviors to
	measurable human motion data. While such plausible control models were able to simulate
	and explain many basic locomotion behaviors (e.g. walking, running, and climbing stairs),
	modeling higher layer controls (e.g. processing environment cues, planning long-term
	motion strategies, and coordinating basic motor skills to navigate in dynamic and complex
	environments) remains a challenge. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning lay a
	foundation for modeling these complex control processes and controlling a diverse repertoire
	of human movement; however, reinforcement learning has been rarely applied in
	neuromechanical simulation to model human control. In this paper, we review the current
	state of neuromechanical simulations, along with the fundamentals of reinforcement learning,
	as it applies to human locomotion. We also present a scientific competition and accompanying
	software platform, which we have organized to accelerate the use of reinforcement learning
	in neuromechanical simulations. This “Learn to Move” competition was an official competition
	at the NeurIPS conference from 2017 to 2019 and attracted over 1300 teams from around the
	world. Top teams adapted state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques and produced
	motions, such as quick turning and walk-to-stand transitions, that have not been demonstrated
	before in neuromechanical simulations without utilizing reference motion data. We close with
	a discussion of future opportunities at the intersection of human movement simulation and
	reinforcement learning and our plans to extend the Learn to Move competition to further
	facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration in modeling human motor control for biomechanics
	and rehabilitation research.
