	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	The locomotion skills developed for physics-based characters most
	often target flat terrain. However, much of their potential lies with
	the creation of dynamic, momentum-based motions across more
	complex terrains. In this paper, we learn controllers that allow
	simulated characters to traverse terrains with gaps, steps, and walls
	using highly dynamic gaits. This is achieved using reinforcement
	learning, with careful attention given to the action representation,
	non-parametric approximation of both the value function and the
	policy; epsilon-greedy exploration; and the learning of a good state
	distance metric. The methods enable a 21-link planar dog and a
	7-link planar biped to navigate challenging sequences of terrain using
	bounding and running gaits. We evaluate the impact of the key
	features of our skill learning pipeline on the resulting performance.
