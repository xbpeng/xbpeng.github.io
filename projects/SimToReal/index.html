	Simulations are attractive environments for training
	agents as they provide an abundant source of data and
	alleviate certain safety concerns during the training process.
	But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often
	specific to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling
	error, strategies that are successful in simulation may not
	transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper, we
	demonstrate a simple method to bridge this “reality gap.” By
	randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training, we
	are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to
	very different dynamics, including ones that differ significantly
	from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This
	adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of
	the real world without any training on the physical system. Our
	approach is demonstrated on an object pushing task using a
	robotic arm. Despite being trained exclusively in simulation, our
	policies are able to maintain a similar level of performance when
	deployed on a real robot, reliably moving an object to a desired
	location from random initial configurations. We explore the
	impact of various design decisions and show that the resulting
	policies are robust to significant calibration error.
