	This work aims to push the limits of agility for
	bipedal robots by enabling a torque-controlled bipedal robot to
	perform robust and versatile dynamic jumps in the real world.
	We present a reinforcement learning framework for training
	a robot to accomplish a large variety of jumping tasks, such
	as jumping to different locations and directions. To improve
	performance on these challenging tasks, we develop a new policy
	structure that encodes the robot’s long-term input/output (I/O)
	history while also providing direct access to a short-term I/O
	history. In order to train a versatile jumping policy, we utilize
	a multi-stage training scheme that includes different training
	stages for different objectives. After multi-stage training, the
	policy can be directly transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot.
	Training on different tasks and exploring more diverse scenarios
	lead to highly robust policies that can exploit the diverse set
	of learned maneuvers to recover from perturbations or poor
	landings during real-world deployment. Such robustness in the
	proposed policy enables Cassie to succeed in completing a variety
	of challenging jump tasks in the real world, such as standing long
	jumps, jumping onto elevated platforms, and multi-axes jumps.
