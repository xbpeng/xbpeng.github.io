	In this work, we present Conditional Adversarial Latent Models (CALM), 
	an approach for generating diverse and directable behaviors for 
	user-controlled interactive virtual characters. Using imitation 
	learning, CALM learns a representation of movement that captures the 
	complexity and diversity of human motion, and enables direct control 
	over character movements. The approach jointly learns a control policy 
	and a motion encoder that reconstructs key characteristics of a given 
	motion without merely replicating it. The results show that CALM 
	learns a semantic motion representation, enabling control over the 
	generated motions and style-conditioning for higher-level task 
	training. Once trained, the character can be controlled using intuitive 
	interfaces, akin to those found in video games.
