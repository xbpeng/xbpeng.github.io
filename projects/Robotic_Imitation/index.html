	Reproducing the diverse and agile locomotion skills of animals has been
	a longstanding challenge in robotics. While manually-designed controllers have
	been able to emulate many complex behaviors, building such controllers involves
	a timeconsuming and difficult development process, often requiring substantial
	expertise of the nuances of each skill. Reinforcement learning provides an
	appealing alternative for automating the manual effort involved in the
	development of controllers. However, designing learning objectives that elicit
	the desired behaviors from an agent can also require a great deal of skill-specific
	expertise. In this work, we present an imitation learning system that enables
	legged robots to learn agile locomotion skills by imitating real-world animals.
	We show that by leveraging reference motion data, a single learning-based approach
	is able to automatically synthesize controllers for a diverse repertoire behaviors
	for legged robots. By incorporating sample efficient domain adaptation techniques
	into the training process, our system is able to learn adaptive policies in
	simulation that can then be quickly adapted for real-world deployment. To
	demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we train an 18- DoF quadruped robot
	to perform a variety of agile behaviors ranging from different locomotion gaits
	to dynamic hops and turns.
