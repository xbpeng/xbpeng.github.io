	Learning physics-based locomotion skills is a difficult problem, leading
	to solutions that typically exploit prior knowledge of various forms. In
	this paper we aim to learn a variety of environment-aware locomotion
	skills with a limited amount of prior knowledge. We adopt a two-level
	hierarchical control framework. First, low-level controllers are learned that
	operate at a fine timescale and which achieve robust walking gaits that
	satisfy stepping-target and style objectives. Second, high-level controllers
	are then learned which plan at the timescale of steps by invoking desired
	step targets for the low-level controller. The high-level controller makes
	decisions directly based on high-dimensional inputs, including terrain maps
	or other suitable representations of the surroundings. Both levels of the
	control policy are trained using deep reinforcement learning. Results are
	demonstrated on a simulated 3D biped. Low-level controllers are learned for
	a variety of motion styles and demonstrate robustness with respect to forcebased
	disturbances, terrain variations, and style interpolation. High-level
	controllers are demonstrated that are capable of following trails through
	terrains, dribbling a soccer ball towards a target location, and navigating
	through static or dynamic obstacles.
