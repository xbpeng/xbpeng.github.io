	Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor
	skills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers,
	such as climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile
	movements with simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to
	the scarcity of motion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors
	and the high cost of acquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC
	(Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character
	Controllers), a framework that leverages machine learning and physicsbased
	simulation to iteratively augment motion datasets and expand the
	capabilities of terrain traversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion
	generator on a small dataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The
	motion generator is then used to produce synthetic data for traversing new
	terrains. However, these generated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as
	incorrect contacts or discontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a
	physics-based tracking controller to imitate the motions in simulation. The
	corrected motions are then added to the dataset, which is used to continue
	training the motion generator in the next iteration. PARCâ€™s iterative process
	jointly expands the capabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating
	agile and versatile models for interacting with complex environments.
	PARC provides an effective approach to develop controllers for agile terrain
	traversal, which bridges the gap between the scarcity of motion data and
	the need for versatile character controllers.
