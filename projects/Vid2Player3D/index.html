	We present a system that learns diverse, physically simulated 
	tennis skills from large-scale demonstrations of tennis play 
	harvested from broadcast videos. Our approach is built upon 
	hierarchical models, combining a low-level imitation policy 
	and a high-level motion planning policy to steer the character 
	in a motion embedding learned from broadcast videos. When 
	deployed at scale on large video collections that encompass a 
	vast set of examples of real-world tennis play, our approach 
	can learn complex tennis shotmaking skills and realistically 
	chain together multiple shots into extended rallies, using 
	only simple rewards and without explicit annotations of 
	stroke types. To address the low quality of motions extracted 
	from broadcast videos, we correct estimated motion with 
	physics-based imitation, and use a hybrid control policy that 
	overrides erroneous aspects of the learned motion embedding 
	with corrections predicted by the high-level policy. We 
	demonstrate that our system produces controllers for 
	physically-simulated tennis players that can hit the incoming 
	ball to target positions accurately using a diverse array of 
	strokes (serves, forehands, and backhands), spins (topspins 
	and slices), and playing styles (one/two-handed backhands, 
	left/right-handed play). Overall, our system can synthesize 
	two physically simulated characters playing extended tennis 
	rallies with simulated racket and ball dynamics.
