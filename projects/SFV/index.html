	Data-driven character animation based on motion capture can produce
	highly naturalistic behaviors and, when combined with physics simulation,
	can provide for natural procedural responses to physical perturbations,
	environmental changes, and morphological discrepancies. Motion capture
	remains the most popular source of motion data, but collecting mocap data
	typically requires heavily instrumented environments and actors. In this
	paper, we propose a method that enables physically simulated characters
	to learn skills from videos (SFV). Our approach, based on deep pose estimation
	and deep reinforcement learning, allows data-driven animation to
	leverage the abundance of publicly available video clips from the web, such
	as those from YouTube. This has the potential to enable fast and easy design
	of character controllers simply by querying for video recordings of the
	desired behavior. The resulting controllers are robust to perturbations, can
	be adapted to new settings, can perform basic object interactions, and can
	be retargeted to new morphologies via reinforcement learning. We further
	demonstrate that our method can predict potential human motions from
	still images, by forward simulation of learned controllers initialized from
	the observed pose. Our framework is able to learn a broad range of dynamic
	skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.
