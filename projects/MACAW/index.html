	This paper introduces the offline metareinforcement learning (offline meta-RL) problem
	setting and proposes an algorithm that performs well in this setting. Offline meta-RL
	is analogous to the widely successful supervised learning strategy of pre-training a
	model on a large batch of fixed, pre-collected data (possibly from various tasks) and
	fine-tuning the model to a new task with relatively little data. That is, in offline
	meta-RL, we meta-train on fixed, pre-collected data from several tasks in order to adapt
	to a new task with a very small amount (less than 5 trajectories) of data from the new
	task. By nature of being offline, algorithms for offline meta-RL can utilize the largest
	possible pool of training data available and eliminate potentially unsafe or costly data
	collection during meta-training. This setting inherits the challenges of offline RL, but
	it differs significantly because offline RL does not generally consider a) transfer to
	new tasks or b) limited data from the test task, both of which we face in offline meta-RL.
	Targeting the offline meta-RL setting, we propose Meta-Actor Critic with Advantage
	Weighting (MACAW), an optimization-based meta-learning algorithm that uses simple,
	supervised regression objectives for both the inner and outer loop of meta-training. On
	offline variants of common meta-RL benchmarks, we empirically find that this approach
	enables fully offline meta-reinforcement learning and achieves notable gains over prior
	methods.
