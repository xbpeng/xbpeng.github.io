	Developing systems that can synthesize natural and life-like
	motions for simulated characters has long been a focus for
	computer animation. But in order for these systems to be
	useful for downstream applications, they need not only
	produce high-quality motions, but must also provide an
	accessible and versatile interface through which users can
	direct a character's behaviors. Natural language provides a
	simple-to-use and expressive medium for specifying a user's
	intent. Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing
	(NLP) have demonstrated effective use of language-based
	interfaces for applications such as image generation and
	program synthesis. In this work, we present PADL, which
	leverages recent innovations in NLP in order to take steps
	towards developing language-directed controllers for
	physics-based character animation. PADL allows users to
	issue natural language commands for specifying both
	high-level tasks and low-level skills that a character
	should perform. We present an adversarial imitation
	learning approach for training policies to map high-level
	language commands to low-level controls that enable a
	character to perform the desired task and skill specified
	by a user's commands. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task
	aggregation method that leverages a language-based
	multiple-choice question-answering approach to determine
	high-level task objectives from language commands. We show
	that our framework can be applied to effectively direct a
	simulated humanoid character to perform a diverse array
	of complex motor skills.
