	Legged robots have enormous potential in their range of
	capabilities, from navigating unstructured terrains to
	high-speed running. However, designing robust controllers for
	highly agile dynamic motions remains a substantial challenge
	for roboticists. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising
	data-driven approach for automatically training such controllers.
	However, exploration in these high-dimensional, underactuated
	systems remains a significant hurdle for enabling legged robots
	to learn performant, naturalistic, and versatile agility skills. We
	propose a framework for training complex robotic skills by
	transferring experience from existing controllers to jumpstart
	learning new tasks. To leverage controllers we can acquire in
	practice, we design this framework to be flexible in terms of
	their source—that is, the controllers may have been optimized
	for a different objective under different dynamics, or may require
	different knowledge of the surroundings—and thus may be
	highly suboptimal for the target task. We show that our method
	enables learning complex agile jumping behaviors, navigating
	to goal locations while walking on hind legs, and adapting to
	new environments. We also demonstrate that the agile behaviors
	learned in this way are graceful and safe enough to deploy in
	the real world.
