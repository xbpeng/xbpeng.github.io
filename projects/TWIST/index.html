	Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental 
	step toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human 
	motion providing an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. 
	Yet, most current humanoid teleoperation systems fall short of enabling 
	coordinated whole-body behavior, typically limiting themselves to isolated 
	locomotion or manipulation tasks. We present the Teleoperated Whole-Body 
	Imitation System (TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation through 
	whole-body motion imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by 
	retargeting human motion capture data to the humanoid robot. We then 
	develop a robust, adaptive, and responsive whole-body controller using a 
	combination of reinforcement learning and behavior cloning (RL+BC). 
	Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how incorporating privileged 
	future motion frames and real-world motion capture (MoCap) data improves 
	tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid robots to achieve 
	unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor skills—spanning 
	whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and expressive 
	movement—using a single unified neural network controller.
