	Human and animal gaits are often symmetric in nature, which points to the use
	of motion symmetry as a potentially useful source of structure that can be
	exploited for learning. By encouraging symmetric motion, the learning may be
	faster, converge to more efficient solutions, and be more aesthetically
	pleasing. We describe, compare, and evaluate four practical methods for
	encouraging motion symmetry. These are implemented via particular choices of
	structure for the policy network, data duplication, or via the loss function.
	We experimentally evaluate the methods in terms of learning performance and
	achieved symmetry, and provide summary guidelines for the choice of symmetry
	method. We further describe some practical and conceptual issues that arise.
	Because similar implementation choices exist for other types of inductive
	biases, the insights gained may also be relevant to other learning problems
	with applicable symmetry abstractions.
